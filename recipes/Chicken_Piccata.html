    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>an Italian-American dish featuring thinly pounded or sliced chicken cutlets, dredged in flour, saut√©ed, and served with a lemon-butter sauce, often including capers. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup capers, drained</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)</li>
        <li>Cooked pasta or mashed potatoes (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Place the flour in a shallow dish and lightly dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 4-5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the butter and allow it to melt, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour in the lemon juice, chicken broth, and white wine (if using), stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the capers and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce has reduced slightly.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for another 2 minutes, spooning some of the sauce over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet and place on serving plates.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce and capers over the chicken and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve with pasta, mashed potatoes, or your preferred side dish.</li>
    </ul>
